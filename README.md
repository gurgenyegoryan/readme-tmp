---

Most modern networking is built either on slow and ambiguous REST APIs or unnecessarily complex gRPC. FastAPI, for example, looks very easy to use:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/sum')
def sum(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b
```

It takes over a millisecond to handle such a call on the same machine.
In that time, light could have traveled 300 km through optics to the neighboring city or country, in my case.

---

To make networking faster, one needs just 2 components:

1. efficient serialization format,
2. an I/O layer without interrupts (hence the name).

Today, libraries like `simdjson` can parse JSON documents faster than gRPC will unpack binary `ProtoBuf`.
Moreover, with `io_uring`, we can avoid system calls and interrupts on the hot path and still use the TCP/IP stack for maximum compatibility.
By now, you believe that one can be faster than gRPC, but would that sacrifice usability?
We don't think so.

```python
from ujrpc import Server

serve = Server()

@serve
def sum(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b
```

This tiny solution already works for C, C++, and Python.
It is even easier to use than FastAPI but is 100x faster.
Moreover, it supports tensor-like types common in Machine Learning and useful for batch processing:

```python
import numpy as np
from ujrpc import Server

serve = Server()

@serve
def sum_arrays(a: np.array, b: np.array):
    return a + b
```

We are inviting others to contribute bindings to other languages as well.

## Benchmarks

All benchmarks were conducted on AWS on general purpose instances with Ubuntu 22.10 AMI, as it is the first major AMI to come with Linux Kernel 5.19, featuring much wider io_uring support for networking operations.

## Single Large Node

We measured the performance of `c7g.metal` AWS Graviton 3 machines, hosting both the server and client applications on the same physical machine.

| Setup                     |   üîÅ   | min latency w 1 client | max bandwidth w 32 clients |
| :------------------------ | :---: | ---------------------: | -------------------------: |
| Fast API over REST        |   ‚ùå   |               1'203 Œºs |                  3'184 rps |
| Fast API over WebSocket   |   ‚úÖ   |                  86 Œºs |               11'356 rps ¬π |
| gRPC                      |   ‚úÖ   |                 164 Œºs |                  9'849 rps |
|                           |       |                        |                            |
| UJRPC with POSIX (Python) |   ‚ùå   |                   ? Œºs |                      ? rps |
| UJRPC with POSIX (C)      |   ‚ùå   |                  62 Œºs |                 79'000 rps |

The first column report the amount of time between sending a request and receiving a response. Œº stands for micro, Œºs subsequently means microseconds.
The second column reports the number of Requests Per Second when querying the same server application from multiple client processes running on the same machine.

> 1: FastAPI couldn't process concurrent requests with WebSockets.

### Free Tier Performance

The general logic is that you can't squeeze high performance from Free-Tier machines.
Currently AWS provides following options: `t2.micro` and `t4g.small`, on older Intel and newer Graviton 2 chips.
Here is the bandwidth they can sustain.

| Setup                   |   üîÅ   | `t2.micro` | `t4g.small` | `t2.micro` w 32 clients | `t4g.small` w 32 clients |
| :---------------------- | :---: | ---------: | ----------: | ----------------------: | -----------------------: |
| Fast API over REST      |   ‚úÖ   |   328  rps |     424 rps |                         |
| Fast API over WebSocket |   ‚úÖ   |   1504 rps |    3051 rps |                         |
| gRPC                    |   ‚úÖ   |   1169 rps |    1974 rps |                         |
| UJRPC with POSIX        |   ‚úÖ   |   1082 rps |    2438 rps |                3399 rps |                39877 rps |
| UJRPC with io_uring     |   ‚ùå   |      ? rps |    5864 rps |                  ?  rps |                88455 rps |

### Reproducing Results

#### FastAPI

```sh
pip install uvicorn fastapi websocket-client requests tqdm fire
cd examples && uvicorn sum.fastapi_server:app --log-level critical &
cd ..
python examples/bench.py "sum.fastapi_client.ClientREST" --progress
python examples/bench.py "sum.fastapi_client.ClientWebSocket" --progress
kill %%
```

Want to dispatch more clients and aggregate statistics?

```sh
python examples/bench.py "sum.fastapi_client.ClientREST" --threads 8
python examples/bench.py "sum.fastapi_client.ClientWebSocket" --threads 8
```

#### UJRPC

UJRPC can produce both a POSIX compliant old-school server, and a modern `io_uring`-based version for Linux kernel 5.19 and newer.
You would either run `ujrpc_example_sum_posix` or `ujrpc_example_sum_uring`.

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ build-essential
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B ./build_release  && make -C ./build_release
./build_release/build/bin/ujrpc_example_sum_posix &
./build_release/build/bin/ujrpc_example_sum_uring &
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientTCP" --progress
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientHTTP" --progress
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientHTTPBatches" --progress
kill %%
```

Want to customize server settings?

```sh
./build_release/build/bin/ujrpc_example_sum_uring --nic=127.0.0.1 --port=8545 --threads=16 --silent=false
```

Want to dispatch more clients and aggregate more accurate statistics?

```sh
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientTCP" --threads 32 --seconds 100
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientHTTP" --threads 32 --seconds 100
python examples/bench.py "sum.jsonrpc_client.ClientHTTPBatches" --threads 32 --seconds 100
```

A lot has been said about the speed of Python code ~~or the lack of~~.
To get more accurate numbers for mean request latency, you can use the GoLang version:

```sh
go run ./examples/sum/ujrpc_client.go
```

Or push it even further dispatching dozens of processes with GNU `parallel` utility:

```sh
sudo apt install parallel
parallel go run ./examples/sum/ujrpc_client.go run ::: {1..32}
```

#### gRPC Results

```sh
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
python ./examples/sum/grpc_server.py &
python examples/bench.py "sum.grpc_client.gRPCClient" --progress
python examples/bench.py "sum.grpc_client.gRPCClient" --threads 32
kill %%
```

## Why JSON-RPC?

- Transport independent: UDP, TCP, bring what you want.
- Application layer is optional: use HTTP or not.
- Unlike REST APIs, there is just one way to pass arguments.

## Roadmap

- [x] Batch requests
- [x] JSON-RPC over raw TCP sockets
- [x] JSON-RPC over TCP with HTTP
- [x] Concurrent sessions
- [ ] HTTP**S** Support
- [ ] Complementing JSON with Amazon Ion
- [ ] Custom UDP-based JSON-RPC like protocol
- [ ] AF_XDP on Linux
